## Introduction

This project is a Doom-inspired first-person shooter game that stands out because it's developed from scratch, with a strong emphasis on raycasting graphics, and extensive use of mathematics and trigonometry. 

## Key Features

- Raycasting graphics engine, delivering that classic style like Wolfenstein and Doom.
- Developed without external game libraries, except for SDL2 for visuals.
- Utilizes complex mathematical and trigonometric computations for immersive game mechanics.
- Used known complex algorithms for optimizations (more about it [here](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html)).
- Future plans include adding weapon mechanics and procedural map generation.

## Project Structure

The project is structured using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. Each component has a specific responsibility. For example, the screen handles graphics rendering, while the world manages everything the player encounters.

## Gameplay

Immerse yourself in the classic first-person shooter experience with intuitive controls and challenging objectives. More details about the gameplay can be found within the source code.
